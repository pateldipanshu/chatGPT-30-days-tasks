This is day 1 where my task is to create the “About Me” section for my portfolio using only HTML and CSS.

# 🎯Requirements 

### Heading: “About Me”

### Profile Image: Add a placeholder profile image.

### Description: A few paragraphs describing who you are (can be mock content).

### Tech Stack List: Show your known tech stack (use `<ul>` or styled badges).

### Make it responsive – look good on mobile and desktop.

### Add smooth transitions on hover effects for any buttons/images.
